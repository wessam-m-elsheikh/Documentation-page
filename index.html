            is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created
            in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and
            influential.
          </p>
          <p>
            C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured
            programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static
            type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level
            access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to
            machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.

          <header>variables</header>
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
          <p>
            In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different
            keywords), for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as
              123 or -123
            </li>
            <li>
              float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as
              19.99 or -19.99
            </li>
            <li>
              char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values
              are surrounded by single quotes
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h4>
          <p>To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
          <code>type variableName = value; <br />int myNum = 15;</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="strings">
          <header>strings</header>
          <p>Strings are used for storing text/characters.</p>
          <p>For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters.</p>
          <p>
            Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String
            type to easily create string variables. However, you can use the
            char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:
          </p>
          <code>char greetings[] = "Hello World!";</code>
          <p>Note that you have to use double quotes.</p>
          <p>
            To output the string, you can use the printf() function together
            with the format specifier %s to tell C that we are now working with
            strings:
          </p>
          <code
            >char greetings[] = "Hello World!"; printf("%s", greetings);</code
          >
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="arrays">
          <header>arrays</header>
          <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.</p>
          <p>To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [ ].

            To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:</p>
            <code>int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};</code>
            <h4>Access the Elements of an Array</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>To access an array element, refer to its index number.</li>
              <li>Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.</li>
              <li>This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers:</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Example:</h6>
            <code>int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};<br>
              printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);<br>
              <br>
              // Outputs 25</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
          <header>functions</header>
          <ul>
            <li>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</li>
            <li>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</li>
            <li>Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>To create a function:</h4>
          <p>To create (often referred to as declare) your own function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses () and curly brackets {}:</p>
          <h6>Example:</h6>
          <code>void myFunction() { <br>
            // code to be executed 
            <br>
          }</code>

          <h4>Predefined Functions:</h4>
          <p>Functions that are Predefined and ready to use within the language itself:</p>
          <h6>Example:</h6>
          <code>int main() { <br>
            printf("Hello World!"); <br>
            return 0; <br>
          }</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="pointers">
          <header>pointers</header>
          <p>
            A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another
            variable as its value.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same
            type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the
            variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer:
          </p>
          <h6>Example:</h6>
          <code>int myAge = 43;     // An int variable <br><br>
            int* ptr = &myAge;  // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of myAge <br>
            <br>
            // Output the value of myAge (43)
            <br>
            printf("%d\n", myAge);<br>
            <br>
            
            // Output the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044) 
            <br>
            printf("%p\n", &myAge); <br>
            <br>
            
            // Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)<br>
            printf("%p\n", ptr);
          </code>
